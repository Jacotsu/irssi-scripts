## What is this?

A loadable module which (I hope) is going to be able to augment the
existing perl API with a bunch of other things.

## Usage

* Edit the Makefile as per the comments at the top.
* `make && make install`
* Start up a spare Irssi client (no point segfaulting your main one)
* `/load perl_plus`
* Party in the streets.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome (i.e.: to demonstrate more useful
things that a module can do)

 * Patches can be submitted via e-mail, or preferably via forking
   and sending a pull-request using GitHub.  The repository for this
   code is `git://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts.git` and the
   corresponding web-page is
   [irssi-scripts/modules](https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/modules).
   
   Details of pull-requests can be found at
   [GitHub](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)
   
 . Please poke me on Freenode IRC (`shabble` on `#irssi`) before
   spending too much time on the code. Use the `git format-patch`-tool when
   emailing patches.
