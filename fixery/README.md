# The Fixery

This is a dumping ground for toxic scripts that have been washed in totally
pure and healthy dispersant solution, thus removing all oil, greasiness, and
probably heartbeat.

Actually, it's just me rewriting or refactoring existing scripts from
http://scripts.irssi.org because I spot some bug with them, or decide
they need extra features.

When there are some here, this will be a shiney exciting list:

* `awayproxy` - Auto-sets /away when all your clients disconnect from a proxying
  irssi instance.  It can also collect up messages during your absence, and
  either /notice them to you when you rejoin, or batch them up and send
  periodically in an email.
  
  * **TODO** Add proper settings support
  * **TODO**
