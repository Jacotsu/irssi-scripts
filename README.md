# Shabble's Irssi Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts I have written or adapted from
others to improve my (and your!) irssi using experience.

## Documentation

If you are here looking for my Irssi scripting documentation, please note that
it has been moved to
[https://github.com/shabble/irssi-docs/wiki](https://github.com/shabble/irssi-docs/wiki)

## Other Things

Many of my scripts require [uberprompt](https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/blob/master/prompt_info/uberprompt.pl) as a
dependency.  Those that do will say so in the comments at the top of the file,
and will probably refuse to load without it.
